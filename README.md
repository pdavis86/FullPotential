# Full Potential
Inspired by the Minecraft mod Ars Magica 2, Skyrim, the Borderlands series, Final Fantasy 12 and the Oasis from the book Ready Player One, this game allows the player to explore their abilities in a new way.


## Key Features
- There is no player level. Each weapon type and spell type has its own level.
- Components for crafting items or spells have randomly generated stats. This means you can craft any level item/spell but can only use it once you reach the required level.


## Credit
- I mainly learned how to use Unity from the tutorials on https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys and https://www.youtube.com/c/DapperDinoCodingTutorials/videos


## Feedback
- Got an idea? Great! Let me know.
- Don't like my code? That's OK. I'm a C# developer so may not have written this mod in the "Unity way". Feedback is always welcome.
- Coded a fix or new feature? Awesome, send me a PR.


## Dependencies
- Requires the TextMeshPro package to be reinstalled


## Code Structure
- API is the code required for any third-party development to be compliant with the game 
- Core is the code fundamental to the game working 
- Standard is my implementation using the API to add Accessories, Armor, Effects, Loot, and Weapons to the game 


## Product Roadmap

See the [Project Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/biH6NdE0/oasis "Go to Trello") for a better depiction of where the game currently stands.
