# Full Potential
This game allows the player to explore their abilities in a new way have drawn inspiration from the Ars Magica 2 Minecraft mod, Skyrim, the Borderlands series, Final Fantasy 12, and the Oasis from the book Ready Player One.


## Key Features
- There is no player level! But you do level particular skills.
- Components for crafting items have randomly generated stats. This means you can craft any level item/spell but can only use it once you reach the required skill level.


### Combat
Choose the appropriate item for the situation
- Ranged Weapon. Uses ammunition so be sure to have enough. Does x2 damage if two-handed.
- Consume a resource (e.g. mana, energy, etc.) to attack, heal, buff, debuff, etc. at range or up close. Takes time to prepare.
- Melee Weapon. Does x2 damage or x4 damage if two-handed. Takes time to wind up and cooldown.
- Defensive. Want to tank? Take a defensive item into battle.


## Feedback
- Got an idea? Great! Let me know.
- Don't like my code? That's OK. I'm a C# developer so may not have written this mod in the "Unity way". Feedback is always welcome.
- Coded a fix or new feature? Awesome, send me a PR.


## Dependencies
- TextMeshPro
- Conifers
- ADG_Textures
- (optional) ParrelSync


## Code Structure
- API is the code required for any third-party development to be compliant with the game 
- Core is the code fundamental to the game working 
- Standard is my implementation using the API to add Scenes, Accessories, Armor, Consumers, Effects, Enemies, Loot, and Weapons to the game
