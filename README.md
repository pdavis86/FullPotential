# Magikum Opus (to be renamed)
Inspired by the Minecraft mod Ars Magica 2, Skyrim, the Borderlands series, Final Fantasy 12 and the Oasis from the book Ready Player One, this game allows the player to explore their abilities in a new way.

## Key Features
- At the beginning, the player has no mana regeneration. They must unlock augments to gain mana from a variety of sources and actions.
- Spells have randomly generated stats meaning the player must level up to be able to craft a more powerful version.
- To unlock the next tier of abilities, players must level up the abilities they currently have.

## Credit
- I mainly learned how to use Unity from the tutorials on https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys

## Feedback
- Got an idea? Great! Let me know.
- Don't like my code? That's OK. I'm a C# developer so may not have written this mod in the "Unity way". Feedback is always welcome.
- Coded a fix or new feature? Awesome, send me a PR.
